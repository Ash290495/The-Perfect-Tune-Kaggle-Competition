# The-Perfect-Tune-Kaggle-Competition
# The Predictive Analysis Competition helped me understand and apply the concepts learnt in Applied Analytics Frameworks and Methods better. It helped me think logically about the supervised machine learning methods taught in class. Unlike the assignments, there was more freedom to play around with the dataset. I followed a methodical approach from start to end and this helped me relate to the data better.
# Overall, this project helped build perspective of applied statistics, machine learning and data modelling. It was a very fruitful experience overall. If I would have had another chance, I would try to improve my models by further cleaning and transforming my data and splitting the column ‘genre’ into individual genres within and creating dummy variables out of it all.
